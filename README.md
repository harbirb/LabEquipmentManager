# Lab Equipment Manager

## Proposal

I will be designing an **application that keeps track of shared
laboratory equipment**. This application is meant to be used by
someone in an administrative position such as a lab manager 
or director of a research lab. This project is of interest to
me because I have enjoyed working in research labs, and I 
have thought about developing applications to improve lab
operations day-to-day. An example of this would be creating
a centralized tool to manage the shared lab instruments and 
equipment. I believe an application such as this would help 
in troubleshooting hurdles in lab operations and help in 
formulating decisions such as budget allocation.


## User Stories
In the context of my lab equipment management application:
- As a user, I want to be able to **add** new equipment to my lab 
inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to **view** the list of equipment in 
my lab inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to **update** the status of equipment 
as *out-of-service*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **remove** equipment from my lab that 
was broken or replaced.
- As a user, I want to be able to select an instrument and **list the 
names** of the scientists who have used it.
- As a user, I want to be able to select equipment and **update the 
running cost** spent on parts and repairs.
- As a user, I want to be able to **view statistics** for the list
of equipment such as the most frequently used, and most expensive item.
